# FireFlower
FireFlower is C program creating firework-like pattern.

The pattern is made of a set of particles, each trying to follow two others, and having a different color. The particle move at constant speed toward there targets with an attraction force proportional to the distance to the target. The particles leave a trace of their color, which progressively disappear. The size of the particle, length of the tail, inerty, and number of particles is either set by the user, or randomly set.
